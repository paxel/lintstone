There is no Thread Thlintstone. Lintstone is a simple actor framework. nough said.


# How to use it?

It's still WIP, but when it's finished you can:

* Implement Actors by implementing ONE method (as a functional interface)
* add thousands of actors on the fly
* enable it by just depending one small maven lib
* enjoy unsynchronized pleasures
